# TSCollectionStreamsOperator
TS talk on 29/01/2019 around functional operators for collections and introducing streams over them

This repo is a copy of the repl.it repo I used for the code examples.
For the repl.it copy, you can find it here: https://repl.it/@joshiraez/TypescriptCollectionOperators

At the same time, you can find the slides here. Can't export the HTML unless I have a paid plan, so only URL for now.

Enjoy :)
